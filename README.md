# 🔍 FindBack AI  
## AI-Powered Lost & Found System for College Campuses

FindBack AI is an intelligent, campus-focused Lost & Found platform designed to solve one of the most common yet ignored problems in college environments — recovering lost personal belongings. Items like ID cards, wallets, phones, laptops, and books are lost daily, but recovery still relies on WhatsApp messages, notice boards, or physical registers, which are slow, unstructured, and unreliable.

FindBack AI digitizes the entire Lost & Found process using **Computer Vision, OCR, and Semantic Search** to connect lost items with their rightful owners through a **secure, transparent, and verified lifecycle**.

## 🎯 Problem

- No centralized system to report or search lost items  
- Keyword-based searches fail when descriptions don’t match exactly  
- Ownership verification is informal and unreliable  
- Many items are never recovered even after being found  

---

## 💡 Solution

FindBack AI introduces an AI-driven Lost & Found system built specifically for college campuses. The platform allows college citizens to report found items, browse a live Lost Item Gallery, and submit claim requests with proof of ownership. Admins verify claims before handover, ensuring trust and accountability.

Each item follows a clear lifecycle: FOUND → CLAIM REQUESTED → VERIFIED → RECEIVED


This prevents duplicate claims, ensures proper verification, and provides clear closure once the item is returned.

## 🤖 AI Core Innovation

FindBack AI goes beyond basic keyword matching by using AI meaningfully:

- **Image Understanding:** Identifies item type from uploaded images  
- **OCR (Text Extraction):** Extracts names, ID numbers, brands, and labels  
- **Semantic Matching:** Matches lost and found items based on meaning and context  
- **Confidence Scoring:** Ranks matches transparently to improve trust  

This enables the system to surface matches that traditional systems miss.

## 🔐 Security & Ownership Verification

To prevent misuse:
- Claimants must submit proof of ownership (unique details, identifiers, context)  
- Admins manually review and verify each claim  
- Items are handed over only after verification and marked as **RECEIVED**  

This human-in-the-loop approach ensures both accuracy and trust.

- Review and verify claims  
- Edit or delete item details  
- Mark items as received  
- Maintain system integrity  

---

## 🔍 Advanced Search & Filters

The Lost Item Gallery supports:
- Live text search  
- Item category filtering

## 🖥️ Platform & UI

- Dark-themed landing website (black background with red & white accents)  
- Pages: Home, About Us, Report Found, Lost Item Gallery  
- “Start Now” to enter Campus App, “Exit App” to return to landing page  
- Website-style campus app UI (no dashboard clutter)  
- Smooth navigation and app-like mobile experience  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (custom dark theme)  
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini Models  
- **State Management:** React Context API  
- **Data Storage:** LocalStorage / In-memory (hackathon-friendly)  
- **Routing:** Client-side routing with smooth navigation

## 🚀 Why FindBack AI Stands Out

- Solves a real, everyday campus problem  
- Uses AI practically, not as a gimmick  
- Secure ownership verification workflow  
- Mobile-first, professional UI  
- Institution-ready and easy to demo  

---

## 📈 Future Scope

- Multi-campus support  
- Email & SMS notifications  
- CCTV-assisted matching  
- Role-based admin access  
- University or city-wide adoption  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

FindBack AI brings structure, intelligence, and trust to a process that has remained manual and inefficient for years. By combining AI with human verification, it ensures that lost items don’t just get logged — **they get returned.**
