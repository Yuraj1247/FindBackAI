🔍 FindBack AI

AI-Powered Lost & Found System for College Campuses

🧠 Overview

Losing personal belongings on a college campus is a common and stressful experience for students, faculty, and staff. Despite being frequent, the recovery process is still handled through manual notices, WhatsApp messages, or physical registers, which are slow, unstructured, and ineffective.

FindBack AI is an intelligent, campus-focused Lost & Found platform that uses computer vision, OCR, and semantic search to connect lost items with their rightful owners through a structured, secure, and transparent workflow.

🎯 Problem Statement

In college environments:

Items are lost daily (ID cards, wallets, laptops, books, phones).
There is no centralized system to report or search lost items.
Keyword-based searches fail when descriptions don’t match exactly.
Ownership verification is informal and unreliable.

As a result, many items are never recovered even when they are found.

💡 Solution

FindBack AI introduces an AI-driven Lost & Found system designed specifically for college campuses.

The platform:

Digitizes the lost & found process
Uses AI to understand images and descriptions contextually
Provides a secure claim → verification → handover lifecycle
Works seamlessly as a website on desktop/tablet and an app-like interface on mobile

👥 Users
1. College Citizens

(Students, Faculty, Staff)
Report found items
Browse the Lost Item Gallery
Search using advanced real-time filters
Submit claim requests with proof of ownership

2. Admin (College Authority)

Authenticate via email & password
Review claim requests
Verify ownership
Edit or delete item details
Mark items as received
Maintain system integrity

🔄 Item Lifecycle

Each item follows a clear and transparent lifecycle:

FOUND → CLAIM REQUESTED → VERIFIED → RECEIVED


This ensures:

No duplicate claims
Proper verification before handover
Clear closure once an item is returned

🤖 Where AI Is Used (Core Innovation)

FindBack AI does not rely on basic keyword matching. Instead, it uses AI meaningfully at multiple stages:

Image Understanding
Analyzes uploaded images to identify the type of item (wallet, ID, phone, bag, etc.).

OCR (Text Extraction)
Extracts visible text such as names, ID numbers, brands, or labels.

Semantic Matching
Matches lost-item descriptions with found items based on meaning and context, not just exact words.

Confidence Scoring
Ranks results with match confidence to improve trust and transparency.

This allows FindBack AI to surface matches that traditional systems miss.

🔐 Security & Ownership Verification

To prevent misuse and ensure items are returned to the rightful owner:

Claimants must provide proof of ownership
(e.g., unique details, contents, identifiers, context).
Admins manually review and verify each claim.
Items are handed over only after verification and then marked as RECEIVED.

This human-in-the-loop approach ensures both accuracy and trust.

🚀 Why FindBack AI Stands Out

Solves a real, everyday campus problem
AI is used practically, not as a gimmick
Clear ownership verification flow
Mobile-first, professional UI
Institution-ready concept
Easy to demo and explain to judges

📈 Future Scope

Multi-campus support
Email/SMS notifications
CCTV-assisted matching
Role-based admin access
City or university-wide adoption

🏁 Conclusion

FindBack AI brings structure, intelligence, and trust to a system that has remained manual and inefficient for years. By combining AI with human verification, it ensures that lost items don’t just get logged — they get returned.
